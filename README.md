## WHY I BUILT THIS

I wanted to build project that built with React Router and had cart functionality. Ultimately, I decided to go with creating a fictional bakery after finding several beautiful images of bakery items on the Unsplash site.

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _LOCALSTORAGE_


### _CONTEXT_



### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints.
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc.
- Using CSS Position, Grid and Flexbox.

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker.
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, images, etc.

## MOST CHALLENGING

## BUGS
