          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            At Nanami's, our baked goods are mixed in small batches, shaped by
            hand, and baked daily. Itâ€™s a process that requires time, but the
            result is well worth the wait. Our menu changes as we go, evolving
            with the seasons. We work directly with small, regional mills and
            farmers whenever possible. Our concept is simple, but far from the
            ordinary: only fresh, natural ingredients are used to make our
            artisanal bread and pastries.
