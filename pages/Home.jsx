          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            At Nanami's our baked goods are mixed in small batches, shaped by
            hand, and baked daily. Itâ€™s a process that requires time, but the
            result is well worth the wait. Our menu changes as we go, evolving
            with the seasons. We work directly with small, regional mills and
            farmers whenever possible, to be able to provide you with the
            freshest baked goods.
